This project is the second part of a collection of three projects for simulating a Product Information Management system (PIM).

This part covers the code written in ReactJS for CRUD data into the PIM-Price-List Server database in order to consume this data in another client project written in ASP.Net Core MVC.
The input data is being processed and validated before being inserted into database. The primary key is not an integer but a string, a unique Item name.
